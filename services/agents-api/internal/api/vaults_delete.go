// @Summary Delete a Vault and all its Credentials
// @Description Atomically removes the authenticated project's Vault and all its stored Credentials without an encryption key, decryption or external requests. Existing Session snapshots, history and recorded retries retain their frozen identities; subsequent credential lookups fail without reselection or anonymous fallback. Already-resolved tokens and running Sessions are not revoked or cancelled. Missing/repeated deletion locally returns 404. Exact hosted archive, post-delete visibility and concurrent/error semantics remain unverified; physical erasure from native history, WAL or backups is not established.
