# Agents API contract

See the [58-operation evidence inventory](operation-evidence.md) for observed official behavior, local verification and remaining unknowns.
The [list-query comparison](list-query-semantics.md) distinguishes measured order
errors from unresolved range, cursor and lookup semantics.
The external reference is [openai-python beta/agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/tree/d7c41efee1b0802b79f3f88a678ef2052b06e9ce/src/openai/resources/beta/agents),
pinned in `upstream.json`. Its resource methods, corresponding types, pagination
and streaming helpers define the compatibility target. This directory records
the boundary; it does not imply that every upstream feature is implemented.

Parsar owns product Agents and Teams. This service owns upstream execution
resources, including reusable Agents and protocol subagents. The OpenAI Agents
Python **SDK** is a separate future dependency for business Team orchestration in
Parsar, not the HTTP contract. Design rules live in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#design-and-compatibility-requirements).

The [resource selector and error qualification](resource-selector-semantics.md)
records nullable Skill references and source Files not-found parameter fields,
with official observations separated from Core acceptance.

## Implementation direction

Keep the independent service, authentication, PostgreSQL/sqlc persistence,
transactional admission and official-client test harness. Replace the parts that
let legacy daemon representations define execution semantics. Starting over is
permitted where a replacement is smaller and clearer; neither a wholesale rewrite
nor compatibility with the old private implementation is a goal.

Concentrate native configuration, structured input/output and Item translation
in an execution adapter. The application core owns execution state and persistence;
engine-specific shapes stay at the adapter boundary. Codex uses its native
app-server; Claude uses the maintained Agent SDK. Reuse native protocols and SDKs
for further harnesses rather than adding another model/tool loop.
The [harness contract and parity baseline](harnesses.md) describes equal-engine
registration, qualification and shared acceptance.
Verify configuration against actual execution: response defaults must not merely
describe values the adapter never applied.

The Worker persists fenced authenticated daemon connection observations and pinned
Environment-event snapshots through the existing execution owner. Session reads
and live SSE also expose safe `self_hosted` output and reservation-owned connection
actions. Public self-hosted creation accepts initial text or empty Sessions on the three enabled harness profiles;
initial input reserves work while returning the connection target promptly.
Later idle text submissions wait for preparation/admission. Cancellation-only events
reuse durable admission without creating work or retargeting retries; pending
pre-Turn input still blocks new cancellation. HTTP acceptance does not establish
native completion or process quiescence. Environment retrieval
exposes durable status and safe empty installation metadata for that profile.
Non-deferred functions and homogeneous result-only batches reuse the existing
callback/application path, with explicit call identity and no new Turn on results.
These callbacks are not installed Environment resources.
Message-only batches append to an active Turn under the same Session lock that
reserves idle work; retries retain their original target through completion and later work.
Populated installation metadata, mixed input and full lifecycle conformance remain
unimplemented; see the [Environment scope](environments.md).
Initial messages commit with creation and a connection action; an initial deadline
failure is queryable before a Turn exists. Ordinary and streamed creation share this path.

The three-harness Docker V1 MVP is accepted: Codex, Claude Code and MiniMax Code
share the execution/workspace contract, with independent Core/database deployment,
Files/Artifacts, cancellation and owned-history continuation. Optional features
still differ. See the [accepted scope and evidence](#accepted-milestone-and-evidence).
The same three harnesses passed historical Core-managed E2B V1 qualification in
PR #705. That route is retired; it does not qualify the new user-managed daemon
enrollment chain. The [user-managed V1 qualification](user-managed-runtime-v1.md)
records separate real deployment acceptance and its exact scope.
Select further work only within current user authorization. Parsar cutover and
business Team orchestration are separate from protocol coverage.

## Upstream resource inventory

This inventory is based on the pinned Python source, not our generated OpenAPI.
It contains 42 distinct HTTP operations in 15 resource classes, excluding async
duplicates, overloads and client-side helpers. There are 42 handler entries; the six
[Subagent reads](subagents.md) have three-harness Docker workflow qualification. The separate
general `/v1/files` source-file API and `/v1/skills` resource/version operations
are outside this 42-operation count.

An implemented route is not complete semantic compatibility. **Accepted** below
means a recorded workflow passed under a specific profile; **partial** means some
variants work; **missing** means no implementation; **unverified** means behavior
has not been shown to match upstream. Do not convert the route count into a
compatibility percentage or treat a Docker result as E2B qualification.

The [execution and tools matrix](execution-tools.md) records message input,
structured output, tool configuration/results, discovery and required-action
recovery by operation, with exact qualified profiles and remaining gaps.

Paths below are SDK resource paths beneath `client.beta.agents`, except Skills
and Versions under `client.skills`. Method names use the Python SDK. Vault HTTP
paths start at `/vaults`, not `/agents/vaults`.

| Resource | Upstream operations | Current coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root reusable Agents | create, retrieve, update, list, delete | Partial create/retrieve/update/list/delete and Session references; configuration/error gaps remain |
| Skills and Versions | create, retrieve, update default, list, delete, content | [Tenant-owned encrypted bundles and hosted references](environment-templates.md); [default metadata/content and deletion evidence](file-resource-semantics.md), qualified upload limits and unresolved semantics |
| sessions | create, retrieve, update, list, delete | Create (ordinary/live), retrieve, list with root-Agent filter, metadata-only update, [idle-only public deletion](official-semantics-alignment.md#session-deletion-lifecycle--september-23) with idempotent owner repeat and owned Docker cleanup; user-managed compute stays caller-owned; general physical cleanup and exact hosted semantics remain open |
| sessions.events | create, stream | Text/cancel/function-result admission and live events; function-action state snapshots supported |
| sessions.turns | retrieve, list | Implemented reads; lifecycle conformance still partial |
| sessions.items | list | Partial Item variants |
| sessions.artifacts | retrieve, list, delete, content | Shared output capture and immutable stored reads/deletion on accepted Docker profiles and [qualified user-managed workflows](user-managed-runtime-v1.md) (prior Core-managed E2B evidence remains historical), including retained downloads after Runtime loss. [Aligned](official-semantics-alignment.md#artifact-capture-and-listing--september-23) output symlink skipping, unchanged-path non-republication, the list envelope and malformed filters; exact upstream defaults/errors, hard-link/special-file capture and cancellation-edge parity remain unverified |
| sessions.subagents | retrieve, list | [Three-harness Docker reads, native lifecycle limits and real evidence](subagents.md); full multi-agent semantics remain partial |
| sessions.subagents.items | list | Qualified own-child history reads; [limit clamping and the list envelope](subagents.md#subagent-visibility--september-23-2026) aligned; full Item variants remain partial. Child work is not streamed on the Session, as observed officially |
| sessions.subagents.turns | retrieve, list | Implemented; child Turns carry the Session's Agent ID and are not Session Turns |
| sessions.subagents.turns.items | list | Implemented; scoped persisted reads |
| environments | retrieve | Three-harness colocated self-hosted implementation and qualified Docker hosted profiles: durable status and safe initial-file metadata; other installation inventory and full lifecycle parity remain gaps |
| environments.files | create, list | [Bounded live listing and inline/source-file creation](environment-files.md) on qualified Docker workspaces; [user-managed enrollment](user-managed-runtime-v1.md) reuses the local implementation with separate real public acceptance. [Aligned](environment-files.md#wire-alignment--september-23-2026) the 201 status, page envelope, query keys, empty pages for non-directory paths on local workspace readers, sampled path/token errors and pending hosted rejection; [aligned](environment-files.md#write-semantics--september-23-2026) parent creation, no-replacement and the 5 MiB inline bound; recursion and other errors remain partial |
| environments.templates | create, retrieve, update, list, delete | [Reusable network, files, env/setup/packages, inline/referenced Skills and Session snapshots](environment-templates.md); other initialization and full semantics remain gaps |
| vaults | create, retrieve, list, delete | Create/retrieve/list/delete with independent tenant persistence, stored status filtering, atomic Credential cascade and frozen Session attachments; archive semantics and full hosted lifecycle parity remain missing |
| vaults.credentials | create, retrieve, update, list, delete | Static-bearer and OAuth create/retrieve/list/replacement/deletion with scoped encrypted storage and dispatch-time refresh; Session attachment and exact-URL HTTPS MCP binding; archive semantics and full hosted lifecycle parity remain missing |

## Core extension inventory

The operations below are implemented public Core extensions. They are excluded
from the 42-operation upstream inventory and must not be counted as OpenAI Agents
compatibility.

| Extension | Operations | Current coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime observations | `GET /v1/agents/runtime-observations`; `GET /v1/agents/sessions/{session_id}/runtime-observation` | Current, read-only, tenant-scoped Session contexts with stable Session-keyset pagination, bounded concurrent sampling, Docker and microsandbox metrics, explicit unsupported/unavailable states, strict `packages/agents-client` projection, and no lifecycle mutation. Kubernetes, E2B, self-hosted telemetry, and automatic idle policy remain unimplemented. See [Runtime observation API](runtime-observability-api.md). |
| Runtime history | `GET /v1/agents/runtime-history/capabilities`; `GET /v1/agents/sessions/{session_id}/runtime-history` | Optional backend-neutral capability and bounded tenant/Session-scoped history contract with allocation/incarnation fencing, explicit coverage and strict client projection. Disabled by default until a production Reader and qualified periodic collection are configured; Durable Web rendering remains pending. See [Runtime history API](runtime-history-api.md). |

For each resource, verify the referenced request/response unions and observable
behavior, not just the route. Non-text initial input, configuration
options, text/image content, function results, environment variants, full Item/SSE
variants, defaults, field omission/nullability and errors need their own cases.
Use strict official-client tests plus raw HTTP assertions; SDKs can accept extra
fields and cannot prove that reported configuration matches the running engine.
Where SDK types or public documentation do not establish behavior, record the
uncertainty and obtain upstream evidence before marking it conformant. Temporary
unsupported errors are implementation gaps, never evidence of full compatibility.

## Accepted milestone and evidence

The three-harness Docker V1 milestone was accepted on 2026-09-20 after
[PR #703](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI-Dev/parsar/pull/703). A fresh source-free Core
package and main-built daemon passed fixed Python SDK 3.13.0/raw HTTP/real Kimi K3
regressions for Codex, Claude Code and MiniMax Code. The profiles use independent
execution databases and no Parsar services or product database.

These final regressions supplement, rather than repeat, every earlier check.
Codex's full 26-check deployment evidence, Claude's hosted/Artifact/crash/security
evidence, and MiniMax's real MiniMax Artifact and Core/Runtime SIGKILL evidence
retain their exact tested scope. The full gate, focused race checks and fresh
Astra high review passed for the candidate; no additional live run is claimed by
this documentation update. Evidence on `zju_a100_2`:

- `~/.parsar/remediation/20260920/three-harness-mvp/REPORT.md` and
  `acceptance-results.json`: final baseline, runs, reused evidence and cleanup.
- `~/.parsar/remediation/20260919/docker-mvp/` and `claude-v1/`:
  preceding deployment and safety acceptance.
- [MiniMax workspace qualification](mcode-workspace-v1.md) and
  `~/.parsar/remediation/20260919/mcode-workspace/`: native isolation and recovery.

Qualification is Linux amd64 Docker V1, not arbitrary host isolation, production
HA, E2B, or Anthropic-model acceptance for Claude Code. No exactly-once guarantee
is made for future model choices: the recorded Kimi continuation limitation is a
new model-issued command after a recovery prompt, not automatic API replay.

### E2B V1 qualification

This is historical evidence for the retired Core-managed E2B route. It does not
qualify current user-managed E2B enrollment or transfer compute ownership to Core.

PR #705 (`9cd1c46c7fab6eeef8cb35ce71f1ea0ca2cf8bc1`) separately qualified
Codex, Claude Code and MiniMax Code with actual E2B and real Kimi/MiniMax APIs.
Fixed SDK/raw HTTP acceptance covered independent Core/database deployment,
Files/Artifacts, auth/tenant and native credential/history isolation, cancellation,
Core/Runtime crashes, exact-history continuation without replay and native network
restrictions. All three runs completed cleanup without fallback. The five Provider
operations passed real lifecycle/race acceptance; `make check` and fresh independent
Astra high review passed. The merged tree matches the accepted candidate.

Evidence: `~/.parsar/remediation/20260920/e2b-runtime-v1/` on `zju_a100_2`, including
`acceptance-results.json`, `provider-real-final.log`, `make-check.log`,
`blind-review.md` and exact image/template build pins. This uses the existing
colocated Runtime contract, with no public resource or protocol expansion.
The qualified Linux amd64 templates require a reachable HTTPS/WSS Core and a
minimum two-hour renewable E2B lease. Expiry destroys volatile workspace/history;
unknown effects cannot authorize recreation or replay. Pools, migration and
user-managed enrollment remain outside this qualification.

### Remaining protocol work

| Area | Missing or unverified scope |
| --- | --- |
| Subagents / multi_agent | Six reads and same-child recovery have three-harness Docker evidence; optional native operations, live child progress, full lifecycle/interactions and tool combinations remain explicit gaps |
| Environment Templates | Unsupported restricted hostname forms and exact hosted errors remain gaps. Referenced null network and capability-list selection follow [qualified inheritance rules](template-null-selection.md). Template-reference env/files/commands/packages composition follows [qualified field rules](environment-templates.md#template-and-inline-configuration-composition). CRUD/list, files, env/setup/system/npm/Python, inline/referenced Skills, Plugins, workspace capability directories and Session references have recorded coverage. Environment Plugin MCP transport and placement limits are [listed separately](environment-templates.md#environment-origin-mcp-plugins) |
| Input and configuration | Non-text initial input, broader content/configuration unions and reasoning/verbosity combinations; [structured output](structured-output.md) has qualified Claude function profiles on none and Core-managed Docker openai_hosted, with other combinations remaining gaps |
| Tools and interactions | [Deferred discovery qualification](tool-search.md), other tool types, effective tool-set enforcement and result/cancel publication ordering; MiniMax public functions and service-origin MCP remain unsupported |
| Vault and Credentials | Archive semantics, in-flight token withdrawal and exact hosted selection/error behavior; static/OAuth CRUD, replacement and scoped dispatch-time refresh are implemented (see credential guide for qualification) |
| Existing resources | Full Item/SSE/Usage variants, omitted/null/default/error semantics, pagination and overlapping lifecycle behavior beyond recorded cases |

An implementation gap and an unknown upstream behavior require different follow-up
work. Retain both explicitly; a restrictive local policy or successful SDK parse
cannot establish upstream equivalence. The Feishu board owns live task selection,
including further deployment qualification; this inventory describes merged behavior.

## Public semantics

The [September 22 wire comparison](official-semantics-alignment.md) records the
bounded official-service observations, aligned responses and remaining differences.
It supplements the fixed SDK baseline; current documentation does not silently
upgrade the protocol.

- Credentials use `POST /vaults/{vault_id}/credentials` and
  `GET /vaults/{vault_id}/credentials/{credential_id}`. The static profile accepts
  `static_bearer` with required string token and HTTPS destination, plus a
  required name trimmed to 1–256 UTF-8 bytes. Tokens remain opaque and nonempty; explicitly empty tokens are rejected before
  mutation, following the sampled official create/update behavior. The local URL profile
  excludes userinfo/fragments and preserves queries without normalization or network
  contact. Public metadata contains identity, owning Vault, name, timestamps and
  auth type/destination; it never returns tokens or ciphertext and can be read
  without the encryption key. Missing encryption configuration locally rejects
  creation/replacement with 503. Attached Sessions can use static credentials for
  exact-URL HTTPS MCP. OAuth grants use the same binding plus
  [scoped refresh and replacement](../../services/agents-api/oauth-credentials.md);
  storage-key rotation, archive behavior and key scopes remain gaps. See the [credential storage guide](../../services/agents-api/credentials.md)
  for encryption and operational limits; this does not establish complete Credential
  or hosted error/retry compatibility.
- `GET /vaults/{vault_id}/credentials` lists only safe metadata, with parent and
  cursor ownership checked within the authenticated project and requested Vault.
  It uses the same paging/filter grammar as Vault listing below. Credential status
  is stored separately from Vault status, defaults active, and never appears in
  the public response. Both active and archived Credentials are included by default;
  synthetic archived fixtures establish read/filter behavior, not archive lifecycle.
  No token/ciphertext column, decryption, execution or encryption key is needed.
  An inaccessible parent is not returned as an authorized empty collection. Existing
  create/retrieve/token replacement and dispatch rules are unchanged; exact hosted
  errors and pagination under concurrent mutation remain unverified.
- `POST /vaults/{vault_id}/credentials/{credential_id}` replaces a static token using
  only required `auth.type=static_bearer` and string `auth.token`. It preserves opaque
  strings, rejects missing/null/type/extra-field mutations and returns safe metadata.
  Ciphertext/update time change atomically within the same tenant/Vault/ID/type/URL;
  name, destination, identity, creation time and Session bindings are unchanged. No
  old-token decryption or MCP call occurs. Subsequent dispatch reads use the committed
  replacement; already-resolved requests may retain the old token. OAuth partial
  replacement follows its pinned union and authenticates the stored grant.
  Storage-key rotation, hot reload/revocation and exact hosted concurrent-update,
  timestamp and retry semantics remain gaps.
- `DELETE /vaults/{vault_id}/credentials/{credential_id}` returns only `id`,
  `deleted: true` and `object: vault.credential.deleted`. It removes one owned row
  and its ciphertext without an encryption key. Local retrieval/update/repeated
  deletion then return 404; lists omit it. Frozen Session choices and history remain
  intact, while subsequent secret lookups fail without credential reselection or
  anonymous fallback. Already-resolved tokens and running Sessions are not revoked.
  Archive relationships, exact hosted post-delete visibility and repeat/error
  semantics are unverified; physical storage erasure is not established.
- Vaults use `POST /vaults`, `GET /vaults` and `GET /vaults/{vault_id}` with the same project/tenant
  authentication and Beta header as other resources. The response contains only
  `id`, `object: vault`, `created_at`, `name` and `metadata`. Omitted name stays null;
  explicit null is rejected. Supplied strings are trimmed and must contain 1–256
  UTF-8 bytes. Omitted/null metadata becomes `{}`; a non-string value returns
  `invalid_request_error` with param `metadata.<key>`.
  Session-specific metadata pair/character limits do not apply. The existing
  64 KiB encoded metadata and 1 MiB HTTP body bounds are local implementation
  limits. Creation does not start execution. Retrieval maps missing, malformed and
  foreign IDs to the same local not-found response. Exact hosted error/retry semantics,
  restricted-key scopes and archive lifecycle remain unverified or unimplemented;
  this is not complete Vault compatibility. Listing accepts `after`, creation order
  (default `desc`), a default limit of 20 clamped to 1–100, and scalar or SDK bracket-array
  `status` filters. Both `active` and `archived` are included by default. The private
  classification is stored, never returned; existing/new Vaults default active.
  Synthetic archived fixtures prove read/filter behavior only. No public archive
  writer or delete-to-archive mapping is implemented. Equal creation times use ID
  order locally. A repeated scalar status is rejected; a scalar combined with
  `status[]` filters by their union. Other hosted query errors and pagination over
  changing data remain unverified.
- `DELETE /vaults/{vault_id}` returns `id`, `deleted: true` and `object: vault.deleted`
  after project-scoped parent removal and atomic cascade of all stored Credentials.
  It needs no encryption key or execution connection. Local parent/child reads,
  repeated deletion and new references return 404; lists omit the removed resources.
  Existing Session snapshots and recorded retries retain their IDs and selections.
  Subsequent secret lookup fails without reselection; already-dispatched tokens are
  not withdrawn. Archive relationships, exact hosted visibility/concurrent errors,
  provider revocation and physical erasure remain separate gaps.
- Reusable Agents use `POST /agents` and `GET /agents/{agent_id}`. Keep their own
  identity, timestamps and metadata separate from Session effective configuration.
  On creation, omitted/null name and instructions resolve to null, metadata to `{}`, tools to
  `[]`, text to ordinary/medium, and multi-agent settings to disabled/null. Enabled
  multi-agent settings default to six concurrent subagents. Function defer-loading
  defaults to false and programmatic tool calling to true. Saving these values
  does not itself admit a native execution. Session references are admitted separately.
- [Explicit disabled tools](tool-policy.md) can be saved, used inline or resolved from saved Agents:
  `web_search.mode=disabled` and `programmatic_tool_calling.enabled=false`. Search
  responses include `context_size=medium` for omitted/null size, nullable domains
  and location; an empty domain list stays empty. Saved Agents keep every pinned
  search mode, saving omitted/null mode as `live`; only explicit disabled mode is
  qualified, so Session admission rejects enabled search unless the Session
  replaces the saved tools. Sessions reject enabled programmatic execution,
  including the default true on a supplied PTC declaration. An omitted PTC declaration preserves native behavior: this is an
  approved difference from the official default-on behavior, not full compatibility.
  Core carries the frozen disabled intent through the common Runtime contract;
  native translation and inventory restrictions stay in adapters. Codex checks
  managed requirements before new/resumed execution; conflicting forced features
  reject before model input. Claude and MiniMax use their restricted tool profiles.
  No independent executor or model/tool loop is introduced. Resource defaults and
  hosted error parity beyond this supported subset remain unverified.
- `POST /agents/{agent_id}` updates only supplied fields. Omitted fields remain
  unchanged; metadata replaces all pairs and null/empty clears it. Name/instructions
  null clears them. Concurrent updates preserve unrelated fields. Existing Session
  snapshots and their recorded creation-retry identity remain unchanged; new Sessions
  resolve the latest saved configuration. No-field updates leave timestamps unchanged.
  Nested fields currently replace whole values and null uses the saved defaults;
  hosted nested/null behavior, no-op timestamp policy and exact errors remain
  unverified. This operation shares the existing saved-configuration coverage gaps.
- `DELETE /agents/sessions/{session_id}` returns the canonical `id`,
  `object=agent.session.deleted` and `deleted=true` after durable public removal
  of a durably idle or failed Session without required actions or pending input.
  A queued, running or waiting root Turn or pending input returns 409
  `conflict_error` without any change; callers cancel first and delete once idle.
  Subagent child Turns and pending Environment file writes do not block deletion. Session/Turn/Items
  reads, live streams, metadata updates and new input exclude the resource.
  Existing streams close on observing removal without an invented deletion event.
  Creation keys remain reserved (local 409); the owner's repeated deletion returns
  the same confirmation and missing or foreign deletion returns 404 ([batch
  record](official-semantics-alignment.md#session-deletion-lifecycle--september-23)).
  Qualified managed Docker deletion also reclaims its owned Runtime;
  broader physical SQL/native history cleanup, immediate native quiescence and
  exact hosted error/retry/overlapping-stream semantics remain unverified or
  unimplemented. Shared devices, saved Agents and other Sessions are independent.
- `DELETE /agents/{agent_id}` removes the tenant-owned saved configuration and
  returns `id`, `object=agent.deleted`, and `deleted=true`. Existing Sessions and
  history are retained; recorded creation retries recover their frozen snapshot,
  while new references to the source fail. Local missing/repeated deletion returns
  404. Exact hosted errors and overlapping creation/deletion ordering are unverified.
- `GET /agents` lists tenant-owned reusable resources with `after`, `limit` and
  `order` (default `desc`). It uses creation-time/ID keysets and the same resource
  mapping as retrieval. Limit 0 is treated as 1 and larger limits as 100; negative
  and non-integer limits reject. Pages contain up to 100 resources, with `has_more`
  and the final resource ID guiding continuation.
  The local default is 20. The list envelope includes `object`, `data`, `has_more`,
  `first_id` and `last_id`; empty pages use null IDs. The pinned SDK omits null
  limits and empty cursors. Exact upstream default/cap, empty-envelope nullability
  and error taxonomy remain unverified; SDK auto-pagination does not prove them.
- Saved Agent model-default reasoning resolution remains missing: an omitted effort
  stays unresolved rather than being populated from a guessed model default. An
  explicit effort/summary is retained. Omitted/null service tier currently follows
  the service's `auto` policy; complete upstream-default/error/retry conformance is
  unverified. HTTP MCP with explicit `service` origin and
  boolean `required` (default false) supports saved configuration and Codex `none` execution,
  with Claude SDK
  also supporting its qualified `none` subset. V1 `self_hosted` explicitly rejects
  service-origin MCP; the old remote combination is retired. Required initialization
  additionally needs `mcp_http_required` on the pinned native profile. Native root
  thread creation/cold resume must initialize required servers before a native
  Turn starts; failure cannot silently replace retained history. Public acceptance
  or queued work does not prove native readiness. Hosted creation timing/error
  parity and continuing server health remain unverified.
  The saved HTTP transport includes `headers:{}`; effective Session transport omits
  headers. Omitted/null `allowed_tools` is unrestricted; `[]` denies all tools.
  Session `vault_ids` attaches tenant-owned Vaults. Explicit `credential_id` must
  belong to an attached Vault and match the exact HTTPS URL; omission/null selects
  one matching static or OAuth credential, zero stays anonymous and ambiguity fails. Private
  immutable selections do not populate the public credential field. Scope is
  rechecked before dispatch-only decryption; authenticated execution requires the
  separate bearer capability and never downgrades on failure. Exact URL/selection
  timing, implicit response population and hosted errors remain local or unverified.
  Other MCP variants and enabled web-search execution remain gaps, not changes to the pinned target
  or claims of complete resource coverage.

- Use `/agents/sessions` beneath the configured API base URL, bearer authentication
  and `OpenAI-Beta: agents=v1`. Do not introduce a competing `/sessions` surface.
- Session creation takes an environment and inline agent configuration or a saved
  agent reference. The saved ID and effective configuration are copied into an
  immutable Session snapshot. Omitted fields inherit; supplied objects and arrays
  replace the entire field ([configuration guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/configuration)).
  Tools null clears the list as specified by pinned `session_create_params.py`.
  Saved metadata never becomes Session metadata. A model name is not a daemon engine name.
  Current admission uses the qualified harness profile for multi-agent execution,
  implicit reasoning, tier `auto`, ordinary text and non-deferred functions.
  Enabled multi-agent/function combinations remain unsupported. Unsupported saved settings fail before
  Session persistence, unless replaced by supported overrides. Other native options
  remain implementation gaps, not excluded protocol variants.
  Fixed SDK/raw HTTP checks cover inherited/overridden configuration, tenant ownership,
  source preservation, independent Session snapshots, retries and service restart.
  New saved-reference Sessions record caller intent before source lookup. Matching
  creation retries recover their accepted snapshot even after source update/deletion;
  changed overrides conflict. Retries also require the original typed creator.
  Known creators without recorded request intent retain resolved-hash behavior;
  records without creator identity reject retries. Neither identity is backfilled. These local
  retry rules are not verified hosted semantics.
  In the pinned `session_create_params.py`, `stream` defaults to false and neither
  `stream` nor `agent_id` permits null. Metadata omission/null defaults to an empty
  map; individual values must be strings, including valid empty strings. Validate
  these distinctions before persistence rather than coercing null to Go zero values.
- `POST /agents/sessions/{id}` updates metadata only: an empty update body
  rejects; `metadata: null` or `metadata: {}` clears it, and an object replaces all pairs. Apply the same string
  and character limits as creation. Preserve execution state, effective configuration
  and the original creation retry identity. Fixed SDK/raw HTTP checks cover these
  distinctions, tenant isolation, active Session reads and restart persistence.
- `GET /agents/sessions` accepts `after`, `limit` (default 20; 0 is treated as 1 and
  values above 100 as 100), `order`
  (default `desc`) and optional `agent_id`. The filter matches the immutable root
  Agent ID, including inline IDs and Sessions whose saved source was changed or
  deleted. Filter before pagination within the authenticated tenant; no source
  lookup is required. Omission lists all Agents. Empty filters, same-tenant cursors
  outside the filter and exact hosted errors/defaults remain unverified.
- `AgentSession` includes the effective agent/environment, Unix-second timestamps,
  `object: agent.session`, metadata, required actions, status, usage and vault IDs.
  A Session remains reusable after its current Turn completes.
- Input, cancellation and function results are submitted through session events.
  Turns are queried through `/agents/sessions/{id}/turns`; do not invent turn-create
  endpoints. Event submissions support the `Idempotency-Key` header.
- Per the [official Session guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/sessions),
  input steers an active Turn and starts a new Turn when idle. Streams are live-only;
  recover missed work through persisted Session/Turn/Items queries, not assumed SSE
  replay. Internal input ordering is not a public event-stream cursor.
- List operations use the upstream `after`, `limit`, `order` and resource-specific
  filters. Stream events preserve the upstream discriminators and payload shapes.
- The upstream self-hosted environment includes an exec-server `remote_url`.
  V1 retains that public resource field while explicitly selecting our private
  daemon transport. It does not claim stock `exec-server` wire interoperability;
  public resource semantics require independent acceptance.
- Environment retrieval returns `object: agent.environment`, its ID/type, durable
  resource status and required non-null `files`, `plugins` and `skills` arrays.
  Hosted initial files report safe frozen metadata; empty arrays do not
  describe native discovery or workspace files created by commands. Unknown
  installation configurations are rejected, not reported as empty. Reads use the
  owning live Session's project partition and do not require execution setup.
  Remaining unsupported installation configuration, full hosted lifecycle and
  exact hosted error semantics remain gaps.

[Environment Templates](environment-templates.md) provide tenant-owned CRUD/list
and immutable Session resolution through the same hosted initialization. They do not
select an E2B image or make unsupported initialization executable.
The supported Docker configuration has [composed real acceptance](environment-templates.md#composed-initialization-acceptance)
across the three harnesses, including frozen source deletion, cold continuation
and cancellation. This does not close the remaining protocol/transport gaps.

## Delivery and verification

| Capability | Current state |

### Public engine profiles

`AGENTS_API_ENGINE` supplies the default for new Sessions. The optional
[Core harness extension](harness-selection.md) explicitly selects an enabled engine;
existing Sessions retain their immutable choice. `AGENTS_API_HARNESSES` explicitly
adds installed deployment profiles without requiring a managed Provider. Model
identity is independent.
All three profiles require implicit reasoning and service tier `auto`. Ordinary
text output is the baseline; [structured output](structured-output.md) has a
separately qualified Claude profile. Enabled `multi_agent` qualification is tracked separately in
[Subagents](subagents.md); other profiles continue to reject unsupported execution. Optional tools/configuration are qualified per
operation and placement; native support is not public admission by itself.

| Engine | Qualified placements and limits |
| --- | --- |
| `codex` (default) | Qualified `none` and Docker `openai_hosted`; public functions with ordered text/image results; service-origin HTTP MCP on `none` only; verbosity follows native policy |
| `claude_sdk` | Qualified `none` and Docker `openai_hosted`; medium verbosity, object-root function schemas and text or successful inline PNG/JPEG results; qualified anonymous/static-bearer service-origin HTTP MCP on `none` |
| `mcode` | Qualified `none` text and Docker `openai_hosted`; medium verbosity; public functions/service-origin MCP, image input and complete public usage breakdown remain unsupported |

All three profiles implement user-managed `self_hosted` enrollment at `/workspace`
through our private daemon transport; [separate real acceptance](user-managed-runtime-v1.md)
records qualified deployments and limits. Service-origin HTTP MCP is rejected on `self_hosted` and hosted local
placements. This does not remove separately qualified Environment Plugin MCP.
The [Docker lifecycle](environments.md#basic-public-docker-hosted-profile) retains
workspace Files/Artifacts, cancellation and recovery with native isolation.
Configure immutable Runtime images explicitly: [Codex](../../services/agents-api/deploy/codex/README.md),
[Claude](../../services/agents-api/deploy/claude/README.md),
[MiniMax](../../services/agents-api/deploy/mcode/README.md).
[E2B packaging](../../services/agents-api/deploy/e2b/README.md) reuses the Runtime
with the official SDK; the user owns provisioning, renewal and destruction.

The shared initialization path supports env/setup and system/npm/Python packages;
see the [evidence and limits](environment-templates.md#verification). Remaining
unsupported startup installations, unqualified restricted hostname forms and hosted
service-origin HTTP MCP remain outside these accepted profiles. Environment-origin
MCP Plugins have a separate [Docker qualification and transport matrix](environment-templates.md#environment-origin-mcp-plugins):
stdio on all three harnesses, Codex HTTP with literal headers or HTTPS bearer,
and Claude anonymous HTTP or HTTPS bearer without literal headers. This batch
does not qualify those new Plugin paths on E2B. MiniMax's private workspace MCP
bridge remains internal transport, distinct from installed Environment MCP servers.

The [self-hosted profile](environments.md#initial-public-self-hosted-profile) uses
user-managed Runtime enrollment and remains distinct from Core-managed Docker. Product `claude_code`
is likewise a separate integration from the API's `claude_sdk` engine key.
Unsupported configurations fail before Session creation; unsupported results fail
before a batch write. Native capability claims cannot replace service profile
qualification, tenant authority or exact binding checks. An existing Session
never silently changes engine/device. See the
[HTTP MCP limits](../../services/agents-api/README.md#http-mcp-execution).

The Store's internal DTO is not the upstream response model. The API layer must
validate and resolve the upstream schema before persistence, and report only
supported options. For example, upstream metadata is limited to 16 pairs with
64-character keys and 512-character values; a storage byte limit is not a
replacement for that public validation. Violations return `invalid_request_error`
with the official `metadata` or `metadata.<key>` param, and Agent configuration
protocol errors report their JSON path; see the
[configuration validation batch](official-semantics-alignment.md#agent-configuration-validation--september-23).
U+0000 in stored strings
is a local PostgreSQL limit and returns 400 without writing; see the
[validation error batch](official-semantics-alignment.md#validation-error-fields--september-23).

Use the pinned official Python client against the actual service, with response
validation enabled, for supported Session/Turn/Items operations, pagination, streaming,
errors, idempotency and tenant isolation. A client import or permissive parsing
alone is not evidence of compatibility. Unsupported capabilities must be explicit
errors, not successful placeholder resources. Add any provider or engine-specific
extension separately from upstream fields and document it here when implemented.

`openapi.yaml` is our generated supported surface; it is not the full upstream
specification. The shared Go wire types are in `v1`. Physical Session cleanup, broader image
message profiles, broader structured-output combinations, broader options/tools, remaining Vault lifecycle,
Subagents and environment/provider resources remain incomplete. Reject unsupported
requests explicitly; persisted saved configuration is not execution admission.

### Native subagent control

The pinned `types/beta/multi_agent_config.py` defines `enabled=false` as disabling
subagent tools. The dispatcher enforces that effective value with a typed daemon
policy and capability admission; the Codex adapter applies native feature controls
on fresh and resumed Turns. Operator feature preferences cannot re-enable them.
Controlled model-boundary tests check absence of direct/deferred subagent tools
while the official function workflow continues to run.

Disabled `multi_agent` continues to remove native child tools. The six public reads
and their neutral identity/lifecycle/Turn/Item observations are described in
[Subagents](subagents.md); native qualification is tracked there. The service does
not infer closure from idle/unload, and public capability declarations alone do
not qualify an adapter. Environment and child tools have separate configuration;
`Agent.tools` is not assumed to enumerate every native utility.

### Turn recovery reads

`GET /v1/agents/sessions/{session_id}/turns` and retrieval by `turn_id`
return persisted Turn states using the pinned official client contract. Lists
support `after`, `limit` (1..100, default 20), and `order` (default `desc`).
The cursor is a Turn ID in the same tenant and Session. Failed turns expose a
generic `internal_error`, never raw engine diagnostics. `usage` exposes the latest persisted complete token breakdown, including cached input
and reasoning output. Missing measurements remain null; Session usage sums recorded
Turn measurements as best-effort usage, without estimating missing history. Session runtime state derives from the latest Turn.

### Item recovery reads

`GET /v1/agents/sessions/{session_id}/items` supports the same list controls,
with a stable Item ID cursor and first-observation ordering. Messages preserve
text, phase and completion snapshots. Commands preserve reported output, exit
code, duration and working directory. MCP calls preserve server/tool identity,
arguments and structured results/errors. Dynamic functions have linked call and
result Items. Native file changes appear as `apply_patch` function calls with
reported changes as arguments; no result is invented when the engine reports none.
Web search exposes its supported action fields.

Terminal Turns make unfinished Items `incomplete`; a failed tool does not imply
that the Turn failed. Native start/completion snapshots and Codex command-output fragments are
available when the daemon emits them; other
tool-output deltas remain unsupported. Tool output is visible to the Session's
authenticated tenant and may include the command's or tool's own diagnostic text.

Reads use the durable index without reconstructing native journals. Existing
indexed history is preserved. Migration 15 requires old unindexed archives to be
prepared by release `906069e` before upgrade; see the
[upgrade procedure](../../services/agents-api/README.md#upgrading-archived-item-history).
The retired archive format could not recover unrecorded message boundaries or
outcomes; those limitations remain in already indexed historical Items.
Other native variants, full reasoning coverage and Items mutation remain gaps.
Qualified child Items are described in [Subagents](subagents.md). Public submission
supports text messages, cancellation and function results.

Legacy Done frames alone do not complete assistant Items. Aggregate answer text
is confirmed by successful Turn termination; failed Turns retain observed deltas
instead of treating adapter diagnostics as assistant output.

Pagination orders by first-observation timestamp, then the Item's immutable
Session position and public ID. New Items retain observation order even when
timestamps match. The index also stores a zero-based output index per Turn for
streaming; inputs do not consume it. Updates and retries do not move Items
or change output indexes. Existing indexed history retains its pre-upgrade
deterministic order rather than guessing an unavailable original source order.

### No-environment execution

The dispatcher executes public `environment.type=none` on an authenticated,
bound host advertising `environment_none`. Codex uses `CODEX_EXEC_SERVER_URL=none`
and verifies native environment state before starting/resuming. Claude SDK uses
its restrictive profile with no built-in tools and only declared function callbacks.
A missing capability or unsupported native method fails rather than silently
allocating a local execution environment. Native state still lives on the host;
function callbacks may access their own resources. This is not filesystem isolation.
User-managed `self_hosted` uses an exact enrolled local Runtime instead. The
former native registry/Noise transport is retired. The pinned native source remains
a dependency reference, not a requirement to expose its executor protocol.
The [Environment assessment](environments.md) separates current boundaries from
historical native transport evidence.

### Public execution admission

`POST /v1/agents/sessions/{session_id}/events` accepts `agent.session.input.message`
with ordered user `input_text` content and [qualified image content](message-input.md), `agent.session.input.cancel` and
`agent.session.input.tool_result`. Successful atomic
admission returns 202 with no body, as observed from the official service.
An empty event array is an authenticated no-op: it creates no Turn or Item and
does not reserve an execution retry key. A retry
key identifies the entire ordered request; conflict does not partially admit it.
Messages start queued work or steer the active Turn. Individual input messages
remain distinct Items even when their text shares one native prompt.

Enable the standalone daemon gateway to run the worker; without it, admission
returns 503. The worker selects capable same-tenant engine hosts, binds each Session
once, and runs at most four Turns concurrently. Queued cancellation needs no live
engine. Active cancellation waits for a native receipt; terminal completion can
win that race. Query Turn/Items to recover results after a stream interruption.

The worker takes a database advisory lease; a second worker cannot start on the
same database. All execution writes use that lease connection and stop after loss
of ownership. Startup marks previously claimed Turns failed without replaying them
and retains queued work. Database fencing does not stop already queued native
commands, recover missing daemon frames or guarantee exactly-once external effects.
Session status reflects the latest persisted Turn; usage reports recorded measurements.

Native verification uses `PARSAR_NATIVE_DAEMON_BIN`, `PARSAR_NATIVE_PROOF_DIR` under
`~/.parsar/`, and `PARSAR_OFFICIAL_SDK_PYTHON` pointing to the pinned SDK environment.
The Store native integration test runs `tests/official_execution.py` against a real
HTTP handler, PostgreSQL, daemon and Codex with a synthetic model provider.

Token measurements use the pinned SDK's `TokenUsage` fields. The optional daemon
`usage.tokens` supplies complete per-Turn counters; journal and terminal writes
replace that Turn's snapshot atomically. Repeated snapshots do not increase totals.
Codex publishes observed active-Turn snapshots before completion through this same
contract. Persisted measurements remain available after cancellation or worker
restart; measurements never received by Core cannot be recovered this way.
Unknown historical breakdowns are not backfilled, and a Session total includes only
recorded root-Turn measurements. Session Turn pages hold root Turns only; Subagent
Turn pages are not an additional accounting ledger. Costs and prices are outside
this execution contract. See [history, events and usage](history-events-usage.md) for client
recovery rules, native measurement limits and bounded official-service evidence.

### Live events

`GET /v1/agents/sessions/{session_id}/events` implements the official live-only
stream. Open it before submitting input. Session in-progress/idle/failed and Turn
created/in-progress/completed/failed/cancelled events carry transition snapshots.
Supported Items emit added/done events; assistant text emits content-part and
text-delta/done events. Inputs, including function results, have no output index. Function results emit
`item.added` and remain queryable; `item.done` only carries agent output. Public
function-result output/error retain the saved submission and field presence;
native error-to-text translation does not rewrite those fields. Completed text replaces
accumulated deltas; cancelled unfinished Items retain their partial content and
`incomplete` status. Codex command-output fragments use the pinned
`agent.output.command_execution_output.delta` event with the command Item ID and
stable output index. Draft Item output accumulates fragments; a supplied final
snapshot replaces it and is not emitted as another delta. Native output quotas and
text conversion apply, so the stream is not a byte-complete stdout/stderr capture.
Pinned native 0.153.4 can omit output emitted before its streaming subscription,
including from the eventual aggregate; this bridge cannot recover unobserved bytes.
That native gap remains open. Older peers may provide completion snapshots only.
Reasoning summaries and other
interim tool-output variants remain outside the supported surface.

Events publish only after their transaction commits. An idle Session keeps its
stream open for later Turns. Reconnection starts at the latest committed position,
including when Last-Event-ID is sent; it does not replay missed work. Connect,
buffer new events, then retrieve saved Session/Turn/Items state to recover. Deduplicate
by Item ID and retain finalized Items when applying buffered updates.

The internal buffer is limited to 256 events / 64 MiB per Session, with a single
oversized-event exception. A lagging reader receives a customer-safe `error` and
disconnects rather than silently skipping output. Slow socket writes time out
without blocking execution. Unsupported event variants are not implied by this endpoint.

Internal function execution uses the same native daemon harness, with resolved
non-deferred definitions and Store result admission. It verifies ordered text/image
results, error text, application receipts, matching action/Item call IDs, cancellation
and native Session continuity. Codex supplies the model transport's default image
detail. This proof uses a synthetic model responder and the real daemon/Codex;
the public workflow below exercises the same native bridge through HTTP. Deferred functions,
other tool kinds and the native 64-definition limit remain compatibility gaps.

Function-action read coverage uses persisted-call fixtures with the real service
handler, PostgreSQL and pinned official client. Call insertion and application
receipts update Turn/Session state atomically; duplicate notifications emit no new
state. Actions remain visible until the execution adapter acknowledges application,
or cancellation/terminal state removes them. This acknowledgement timing and the
exact sequence of repeated `requires_action` notifications are implementation
choices: the pinned source defines their shape but not that precise ordering.
Session state events contain `event_id`, `type` and `session`; Turn events retain
`session_id` and `turn_id`. There is no invented Turn `waiting` event.

Public function-result admission is verified with the pinned Python client and
raw HTTP against a dedicated PostgreSQL fixture: required fields, nullable output
and error, ordered text/image output, variant rejection, atomic batches, scoped
access and retries after terminal state. This admission verification complements the native public workflow below.
The generated Swagger 2.0 document leaves the output union unconstrained because
it cannot express string-or-content-array unions; the pinned upstream types and
server validation define the supported alternatives.

### Public function configuration

Inline `agent.tools` accepts `function` definitions with the upstream
required name, description and JSON Schema parameter object. Missing
`defer_loading` resolves to `false`; null and other types are rejected. Omitted,
null and empty tool lists resolve to an empty list. The resolved tools are part of
the immutable Session configuration and creation retry identity. Saved-Agent
inheritance uses the same resolved tools. The bounded [deferred discovery path](tool-search.md)
adds type-only `tool_search` for its qualified profile. Other discovery combinations, other tool kinds,
the native 64-definition cap and nonblank names of at most 512 bytes remain
compatibility gaps; repeated names and explicit non-object root types reject as
officially. Claude SDK additionally requires an explicit object root. It accepts text and
successful inline PNG/JPEG function results on `none` and Docker `openai_hosted`;
failed images, unqualified placements and remote references
remain gaps. See [function image coverage](function-result-images.md). Codex internal Goal/Skills/user-input/discovery semantics need
upstream evidence; their presence alone does not prove a tool-set mismatch.

The worker selects a same-tenant host advertising `function_tools` for configured
Sessions. Work remains queued when no compatible host is available, including
when a previously bound host no longer advertises that capability. It does not
silently discard the definitions or move an existing native Session.

`TestNativePublicFunctionExecution` runs `tests/official_functions.py` using the
pinned official SDK against the actual HTTP handler, worker, PostgreSQL, daemon
and Codex. A synthetic model requests a configured function; the client reads
`required_actions`, submits ordered text/image results through public events,
retries the same result, receives completion, and reuses the Session. A subsequent
Turn verifies error output, and a third verifies cancellation while waiting.
The test checks native result receipts, retained function Items and no duplicate
native continuation. This proves the implemented workflow, not compatibility
with every tool variant or the upstream service's exact event timing.

Accepted results currently enter public Items through native execution observations.
If cancellation prevents native application (for example, a result followed by
cancel in one admitted batch), the submission remains saved internally but has no
public result Item or `item.added`. Admission-time result indexing and unapplied
result recovery remain a separate compatibility gap; retries do not repair it.

`TestNativePublicFunctionStreamHelper` runs `tests/official_function_stream.py`
with the same native fixture and pinned SDK. `sessions.stream(tool_handlers=...)`
submits a mapping returned by a handler and a generic failure when the handler
raises. It verifies one invocation per call, retained output/error field presence,
native application, and termination after the matching Turn completes and Session
returns idle. These are controlled tests with synthetic model responses. Live
execution acceptance additionally requires a real model API; provider connectivity
alone does not prove the Agents API/daemon/harness workflow.

### Default verbosity on native models

The pinned `AgentTextParam` defines `medium` as the default text amount. Omitted,
null and explicit `medium` keep the same effective Session configuration and retry
identity. Supported native models receive the explicit requested level. For
unsupported or unknown models, the Codex adapter removes a `medium` override and
uses native defaults while preserving the requested model and catalog snapshot.
It still rejects unsupported `low`/`high` and unreadable catalogs.

This follows [Codex 0.153.4 request selection](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.153.4/codex-rs/core/src/client.rs#L951)
and its [unknown-model fallback](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.153.4/codex-rs/models-manager/src/model_info.rs#L134).
Controlled native verification checks explicit levels on supported models, absent
verbosity on an unknown model, initial/resumed Turns, and default retry equivalence.
This does not imply support for non-default verbosity on every model.

Live MiniMax-M3 verification used the pinned SDK, actual service/worker/PostgreSQL,
daemon and Codex with MiniMax's real Responses API. Two Turns verified a successful
function result, handler failure, retained result fields, stream termination and
native history continuity by recalling a random value returned only by the first
tool invocation. Omitted, null and explicit medium reused the same creation
identity. The tool data was synthetic; model responses were live. This does not
establish non-default verbosity, tool-set enforcement or full protocol conformance.

### Initial input at Session creation

Session creation accepts the pinned string and user-message-array input
forms. It shares message validation and admission with the events endpoint,
including the [qualified image profile](message-input.md). The
Session and its initial work commit atomically; an identical
creation retry never re-admits the input, including after later or terminal Turns.
With `none`, this includes the first Turn and input Items. With `self_hosted`, it
includes the initial reservation and connection action; preparation and Turn
admission belong to the existing Worker. Creation returns while the executor is
offline, and an initial deadline failure leaves a failed Session without a Turn.
Initial input is required for `none`, and for streamed creation outside
`self_hosted`. Non-streaming hosted and self-hosted creation may omit input or
supply null. These conditions apply before creation retry lookup; valid retries
retain the same Session and never duplicate initial work. Existing Session reads
and subsequent events are unaffected. Execution must be enabled and the
configured engine must support admission before any initial work is persisted.

Fixed SDK/raw HTTP and PostgreSQL tests cover the accepted forms, saved and inline
configuration, ordering, tenant isolation, retries, rollback and persistence.
Image support is bounded as documented above. Empty arrays, empty content and
empty text fail the shared message validator, as official probes also did.
Whitespace-only text is admitted and stored verbatim, as officially observed
([text content](message-input.md#text-content)). Full local size-limit and error-detail parity remains unverified. Swagger 2 cannot
express the string/array union, so input is unconstrained with a type description.

### Session creation streaming

`POST /v1/agents/sessions` also accepts `stream=true` for the supported creation
inputs. Fresh creation sends `agent.session.created` with the committed Session,
the same projection as the JSON 201 body (`in_progress` after `none` initial
input), then its committed activity/Turn/Item/output events. A new Turn publishes
`turn.created`, its user input `item.added`, `agent.session.in_progress`, then
`turn.in_progress`. Self-hosted initial creation shows and then emits the
Environment connection request, before native readiness and a Turn. The cursor
comes from the atomic creation upsert, so rapid initial execution cannot move the
start past its own events. The ordinary bounded-buffer/gap policy still applies.

A fresh creation stream ends right after the first `agent.session.idle` recorded
when a Turn ends or an input reservation stops being pending (expired, cancelled
or failed), or any `agent.session.failed`, and never sends the events after it. A
pinned-SDK loop over `sessions.create(..., stream=True)` therefore ends right
after the initial Turn's idle. `requires_action`, function results, resumed work
and a self-hosted connection clearing pending input keep it open, and a
provisioning or offline reservation keeps it open until a Turn settles or the
reservation expires or fails. A creation that admitted nothing ends right after
`created`. A settlement that records no event ends the stream after the events
up to the cursor read with a settled projection in one snapshot; another client's
work drained before that read can still be sent. Observe later Turns with the GET
event stream, which never ends on its own. Terminal Turn events carry the Turn
snapshot's `usage` at the top level, null when unknown.

The local `Idempotency-Key` creation extension shares identity across response
modes. A same-key `stream=true` retry of an existing creation returns 201 with
only the connection comment and ends at once: it replays nothing, resubmits no
input and follows no work, since official same-key requests create distinct
Sessions. Recover a lost
Session ID by repeating the same request/key with `stream=false`, then use
Session/Turn/Items reads. Disconnect only stops the HTTP observer; committed
reservations and admitted execution continue. September 23 official `none`
observations match the created snapshot, the end at idle, the start order and the
terminal usage field ([evidence](history-events-usage.md#creation-stream-settlement-2026-09-23)).
Self-hosted, hosted and no-input creation stream lifetimes and the stream retry
behavior are local choices.
These choices are not full conformance.

`official_session_creation_stream.py` covers the pinned client and raw HTTP on
real PostgreSQL: initial text and saved Agents, created snapshots equal to the JSON
201 body, Turn start order, terminal usage, the end at idle, GET continuation,
immediately ending stream retries and JSON retries, disconnect recovery, isolation
and errors before stream headers. Store tests cover concurrent upsert ownership,
pre-admission cursors, post-admission projections and observers draining after
execution has completed; API tests cover the stream lifetimes.

## Acceptance evidence and remaining scope

These accepted changes have distinct evidence levels. The associated PR records
include validation and limitations; later acceptance does not upgrade an earlier
controlled fixture into a real-provider test.

Principal workflows above are accepted within their profiles. Missing resources,
broader configuration/content, complete Usage provenance, unapplied result
visibility, exact hosted errors/event timing and crash-window reconciliation remain
open. Claude SDK raw usage is retained internally; public usage stays null without
a complete token breakdown. Neither successful cold continuation nor database
writer fencing proves recovery of interrupted native side effects. Full protocol
compatibility, other harnesses/platforms and Parsar cutover are not established.

### Caller principal foundation

Caller keys now resolve an explicitly configured organization/project and typed
user/service-account identity. An immutable project-to-tenant mapping is verified
against PostgreSQL before startup. Optional official organization/project headers
must match the key's authorized scope; ambiguous or conflicting headers use the
existing `401 invalid_api_key` response. This error policy is an implementation
choice, not verified hosted error parity. Project resource access remains shared
within the authorized project. New Sessions persist immutable creator kind/ID from
the authenticated principal; ordinary and streaming creation retries require the
same typed subject, including when recovering before saved-Agent lookup. Rotated
keys for that subject share retry identity. Unknown historical creators cannot be
claimed by retry. This local 409 policy is not verified hosted retry parity.
Creator fields remain internal and do not extend the public Session schema.
Executor keys now require the target Session's verified project and typed creator,
with optional exact-Environment restriction. Key issuance can precede Session
creation; rotation/revocation and current authorization reuse the durable ledger
and exact Runtime enrollment/gateway binding. Historical keys remain revoked and unclaimed. This
executor-specific prerequisite does not open public Environment admission or
establish complete ownership, hosted key lifecycle or error compatibility. See the
[standalone configuration](../../services/agents-api/README.md#standalone-http-service).

Core documents its optional [harness selection extension](harness-selection.md) separately from the pinned upstream contract.

The [Core startup configuration extension](startup-configuration.md) exposes only
safe build support and process configuration facts. It does not report Runtime,
Session or Environment observations and is not a readiness endpoint.

Model endpoints and credentials may be supplied at Session creation through the
[write-only execution extension](model-execution.md). Provider catalogs and their
business permissions remain client/product responsibilities.
