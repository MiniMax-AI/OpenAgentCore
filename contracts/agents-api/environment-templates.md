# Environment Templates and initialization

Core owns reusable configuration through the five pinned
[Template operations](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/d7c41efee1b0802b79f3f88a678ef2052b06e9ce/src/openai/resources/beta/agents/environments/templates.py).
Templates do not contain a running workspace and do not select a provider image.
An E2B `templateID:build_UUID` remains private operator packaging configuration.
Each referencing Session obtains its own Environment through the same initialization
and five-operation SandboxProvider path as inline configuration.

## Supported batch

- Create, retrieve, update, delete and list under `/v1/agents/environments/templates`.
  Every operation requires project authentication and `OpenAI-Beta: agents=v1`.
  CRUD/list works without an execution deployment.
- Optional nullable name, preserved verbatim, with a local 1–256 Unicode character
  bound. Network supports `enabled`, `disabled` and exact-host `restricted`; omitted/null create network
  defaults to the pinned enabled policy. Update omission preserves; supplied name
  or network replaces, with null clearing name or resetting network.
- Empty/null installation fields retain empty defaults. Responses contain safe
  metadata and never `env`, `setup_commands` or inline file data. Initial files are
  supported as described below, together with inline Skills, env, ordered setup and system/npm/Python packages; remaining populated installations reject explicitly.
- Listing uses `after`, `limit` (1–100, default 20), and `order` (default `desc`).
  Creation timestamp plus ID supplies stable local ordering. Missing/foreign IDs
  and cursors return the same not-found result. No compute is allocated by CRUD.
- Session `environment_template_id` resolves under the caller's tenant. Omitted
  network inherits; enabled can narrow to restricted or disabled. Restricted can
  narrow to an exact-host subset or disabled; disabled cannot widen. Effective
  configuration is frozen without passing the template ID to execution.
- Updating/deleting a template does not change existing Sessions. Creation retries
  recover recorded caller intent before template lookup, including after deletion;
  changed intent conflicts. This is the existing local retry policy, not a claim of
  complete upstream idempotency semantics.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="https://your-core.example/v1", api_key="your-project-key")
template = client.beta.agents.environments.templates.create(
    name="Python workspace", network={"access": "disabled"},
    env={"APP_MODE": "analysis"}, packages={"python": ["packaging==26.0"]},
    setup_commands=[{"command": "mkdir -p /workspace/outputs"}]
)
session = client.beta.agents.sessions.create(
    agent={"model": "your-configured-model"},
    environment={"type": "openai_hosted", "environment_template_id": template.id},
    input="Create /workspace/outputs/report.txt containing the result of 6 * 7.",
)
# Inspect Session/Turn/Items and retrieve published Artifacts after completion.
# Delete the Session to reclaim its Environment; template deletion is independent.
```

## Initial files

Both inline hosted configuration and reusable templates accept `files` entries with
an absolute destination inside `/workspace`: `inline` with standard-base64 `data`, or
`file_id` referencing a project-owned Files API upload. The guide's limits are 50
initial files, 5 MiB per inline file, 10 MiB total inline content, and 50 MiB per
referenced file. Session/Template JSON requests allow 16 MiB for the base64 envelope.
Paths must be canonical, distinct and stay within the workspace; symlinks are not
followed. A failed install never starts native execution.

Configure `AGENTS_API_CREDENTIAL_KEY_FILE` with the existing execution-service
base64 32-byte encryption key. Template writes and Session resolution need it;
ordinary metadata reads do not. Template inline metadata contains type/path/size,
while references contain type/path/file_id. Sessions receive fresh file IDs and
sizes for both variants. Initialization keeps file data out of ordinary configuration,
resource responses, lifecycle events and command arguments. Templates keep references; each Session authorizes and
freezes its own encrypted source bytes. Later source deletion cannot change them.

Template `files` omission preserves on update; null/[] clears. Referenced Sessions
inherit files. Supplying `files` together with `environment_template_id`, including
null/[], explicitly rejects while replacement/merge/null semantics remain unconfirmed.
Use a complete standalone inline configuration when a different file set is needed.

Core initializes both paths with the same trusted file installer through Provider
RunCommand. Daemon authentication remains available, but native preparation and live
Files wait for all writes. Each file gets a two-minute transfer budget; the batch has
a thirty-minute local budget and shares maintenance scans with other allocations.
These are local operational limits, not verified upstream timing. Initial input
retains its existing five-minute admission deadline; large installations can use an
idle Session and wait for connected status before submitting input.

Uncertain writes and Core restart during initialization fail the new Environment and
reclaim it; they do not replay partial installation. After completion, reconnect and
native-history recovery preserve user modifications instead of reinstalling files.
Docker/E2B and all three harnesses use this same lifecycle. The Provider API remains
five operations; public Templates are never E2B image templates.

## Inline Skills

Both templates and standalone hosted configuration accept inline Skill ZIPs:

```python
import base64
from pathlib import Path

skill = {
    "type": "inline", "name": "report", "description": "Create the report.",
    "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "application/zip",
               "data": base64.b64encode(Path("report.zip").read_bytes()).decode()},
}
template = client.beta.agents.environments.templates.create(skills=[skill])
```

Each archive contains one top-level folder with `SKILL.md` and optional supporting
files. The manifest name/description must match the request. Portable descriptive
frontmatter supports `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility` and string
`metadata`; native hooks, permission controls and subagent directives reject.
Local limits are 50 Skills, 5 MiB compressed and 20 MiB expanded per archive,
10 MiB compressed and 50 MiB expanded in total, and 1,000 entries per archive.
Regular files only: path traversal, links, duplicate destinations, special files
and invalid manifests reject. Content is inert during installation; executable
files retain their executable bit. These operational limits are not claims about
upstream limits.

Responses contain only type/name/description. Archive content stays in encrypted,
resource-bound template and Session snapshots. Updates replace supplied `skills`;
omission preserves and null/[] clears. Existing Sessions retain their frozen
content after template update/deletion. A template reference with an explicit
Skills override rejects pending confirmation of upstream merge semantics.

The shared initializer installs Skills under
`/environment/initialization/capabilities/skills/<name>` before setup and native execution.
Setup and native tools can read that tree but cannot write it; completed recovery
never reinstalls it. The execution contract carries installed metadata only.
Codex registers native extra roots, Claude creates its own explicit Skill plugin
envelope, and MiniMax points its native user-global catalog at the shared root.
MiniMax retains disabled unrestricted built-in tools and uses its existing
isolated workspace tool worker. No Provider or model/tool loop is added.

Codex nested `SKILL.md` discovery, `agents/openai.yaml` native dependency
configuration and Claude inline/fenced shell preprocessing are not qualified in this batch and explicitly fail adapter
preparation. Other files are not interpreted as a public plugin installation.
Public `skill_reference`, `/v1/skills` version resolution, generic Plugins and
capability-directory imports remain separate gaps. Native built-in Skill visibility
is not evidence of exact public tool-set parity. Qualification probes alone do not
establish complete public support; record real service acceptance separately.

## Packaged Runtime initialization contract

Template handlers and stores resolve public configuration without choosing a
harness, native path or compute backend. The common initialization lifecycle uses
the following existing Linux Runtime packaging requirements through Provider
`RunCommand`; these are private deployment requirements, not public Template fields.

- `/workspace` is the public workspace. `/environment/workspace` names the same
  storage for trusted initialization; `/environment/staging` is private staging.
- `/usr/bin/python3 -I -S` runs the trusted, fd-anchored initial-file installer.
  It invokes the existing `/usr/local/bin/agents-api-codex-write` atomic writer.
  That executable is a shared filesystem helper packaged for every harness; its
  historical name does not select Codex or invoke native Codex tools.
- Confidential content travels on bounded stdin. Successful initialization needs
  the writer's versioned completion receipt and confirmed process exit. Unknown
  effects use the existing allocation cleanup path rather than replay.
- Provider implementations preserve argv, stdin, exit status and allocation
  ownership. They do not interpret public templates. Runtime adapters own native
  configuration; initialization must not consume a harness's private history,
  model credentials or native tool protocol.

New hosted harnesses reuse these helpers and paths; new Providers deploy the same
Runtime contract. Neither addition should change template validation, storage or
resolution. Extend this contract only for an accepted initialization requirement.
The trusted `/usr/local/bin/agents-api-runtime-initialize` receives a bounded
version-1 JSON operation on stdin. It configures read-only tool env under
`/environment/initialization`, installs packages under `/environment/packages`,
and runs ordered commands through distro bubblewrap. The fixed mount/process map
excludes daemon credentials, native history and staging. User values are applied
inside isolation, never to the launcher. Receipt and process exit must both confirm
completion; child output is discarded because it can contain secrets.

Runtime receives a `tool_environment` execution flag, without template identity or
provider information. Adapters validate the common files and apply them in their
native tool sandbox: Claude uses its native Bash hook, Codex its managed Bash hook,
and MiniMax its isolated native-tool worker. Native transports remain unchanged.
Files reads do not require initialized tool configuration. Docker setup requires
the existing nested-sandbox deployment profile for every harness; E2B supplies
the same Runtime layout and kernel isolation.

Codex 0.153.4 can execute an original command when a native hook process fails.
The adapter verifies the required trusted managed hook before preparation and
stops the Turn on an observed failed hook. Earlier command effects may already
exist; this is not an atomic hook-failure prevention guarantee.

## System packages

`packages.system` accepts package names for the Runtime's Debian apt repositories,
in both templates and inline hosted configuration. Real apt/dpkg installs packages
and runs package scripts before npm/Python dependencies and setup commands. Template
updates replace the package object; omission preserves it and null clears it.
Referencing Sessions freeze the existing template configuration.

Each Runtime image supplies a seed built before daemon, harness and credential
installation. The common initializer extracts it into
`/environment/packages/system` under the unprivileged Runtime identity. Matching
package databases and base tools are included; private Runtime files and native
history are absent. Installation uses its own process/filesystem view. Package
output is not exposed in public diagnostics. A failed or uncertain installation
fails the Environment through the existing lifecycle and is not replayed.

Setup and native shell tools enter this installed root read-only, with the same
workspace and adapter-owned temporary storage. Trusted launchers stay outside the
package-controlled root. Codex uses its managed hook, Claude its full-shell prefix,
and MiniMax Code its existing tool worker; native execution and cancellation retain
their existing owners. Core carries only the required initialized-tool condition.
Files operations retain their existing authorization and initialization boundary.

This is a single-UID tool environment, not a full operating-system service manager.
Packages requiring additional Unix identities, privileged operations or background
system services may fail explicitly. There is no apt mirror, package cache, arbitrary
root installation or package retry mechanism. Existing operation and initialization
time budgets apply. New harnesses implement the same Runtime contract rather than
adding template-specific business logic.

## Restricted network policy

Template and inline configuration share Core validation, persistence and resolution.
`restricted` requires 1–100 exact ASCII hostnames; subdomains and redirect destinations
need their own entries. Unsupported host forms (wildcards, URL/port syntax, IP literals,
Unicode and trailing dots) reject explicitly. This is a qualified subset, not a
claim of complete upstream hostname normalization or TLS routing semantics.
Public reads preserve supplied spelling, order and duplicates. Effective native
comparison uses a separate lowercase, deduplicated copy; updates cannot change
existing Session snapshots or retry intent.

Provider bootstrap and preparation carry the same frozen policy. Runtime rejects
mismatches and missing hosted execution policy. Read-only workspace access retains
its existing minimal prerequisites. Core owns no native proxy configuration:
Codex uses its managed network ceiling, while Claude and MiniMax use native sandbox
allowlists. Provisioning remains a separate phase before runtime restrictions.
Current qualification evidence must cover real Docker native execution, permitted
and denied hosts, credential isolation, Files/Artifacts, cancellation and retained
policy on recovery; resource tests alone do not establish execution compatibility.

## Explicit gaps and evidence boundaries

Nonempty `capability_directories` and `plugins`, and Skills API references,
remain unsupported
for both templates and inline initialization. The separate live Files API remains
available after initialization. Unsupported requests reject without echoing payloads.

The [hosted guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/openai-hosted)
clarifies that configured env values are readable by Agent code, files/packages
precede setup commands, nonzero setup prevents start, and runtime-reserved env names
must reject. The shared initialization batch implements those fields with encrypted snapshots
and the existing readiness gate. Public reads show packages but omit env/commands.
Template updates replace each supplied field; omission preserves it and null clears
it. Referenced Sessions inherit the snapshot; explicit env/packages/setup overrides
with a template ID reject while override semantics remain unconfirmed.

Files and inline Skills are installed first, followed by system, npm/Python packages and ordered commands;
the default cwd is `/workspace`. One command or package operation has the existing
two-minute local budget, within the thirty-minute initialization budget. No command
is retried after unknown effects. Completed setup never runs on reconnect.
Package dependencies are available to native tools across working directories.
System packages use the isolated tool root described above.

The [update Reference](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/python/resources/beta/subresources/agents/subresources/environments/subresources/templates/methods/update)
defines runtime network as post-setup and packages as preceding that policy.
Initialization therefore uses its isolated provisioning network; native tools
apply the requested enabled/disabled/restricted policy afterward. Allowing setup internet is
an implementation inference from that phase boundary, not an explicit upstream
guarantee. Env values are intentionally readable by Agent code; they must not
appear automatically in public metadata or initialization diagnostics.

The [current Template reference](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/python/resources/beta/subresources/agents/subresources/environments/subresources/templates)
mentions different GA/beta defaults; this service retains `agents=v1` and the
[fixed baseline](upstream.json), whose omitted network is enabled. Exact upstream
errors, no-op timestamps, concurrent pagination and referenced Session null-network
override semantics remain unverified. The last case explicitly rejects in this
batch rather than guessing inheritance. This batch is not full protocol compatibility.

## Verification

### Restricted-network Docker acceptance (2026-09-21)

The fixed SDK 3.13.0 and raw HTTP passed restricted-policy CRUD, tenant isolation,
template narrowing and immutable creation-retry checks against the standalone Core.
Current Core/daemon builds with Codex 0.153.4, Claude Code and MiniMax Code passed
real Kimi/MiniMax execution, initialized system tools and Skills, Files/Artifacts,
credential isolation, cancellation with observed descendant cleanup, and retained
workspace/native history after separate Core and Runtime restarts. Codex exercised
both template and inline configuration; Claude and MiniMax exercised templates.

Separate real-model network runs on all three Docker profiles verified HTTP and
certificate-checked HTTPS to allowed sites, rejection of an unlisted host and
subdomain, rejection after an allowed site's redirect, and failure of direct-IP or
proxy-free access. Allowed HTTPS, host rejection and direct-bypass checks repeated
after Core/Runtime restart with the frozen policy and retained conversation history.
The checks use actual tool effects, native command Items where available and exact
transport connection counts, not the model's assessment. All accepted runs cleaned
their owned containers, volumes and test transport.

The test host lacked direct DNS/TCP egress. A task-only network-namespace route and
transparent sidecar carried unchanged HTTP/TLS bytes to real sites through the
existing outlet; host routes, Runtime capabilities, native policy and certificate
validation stayed unchanged. This qualifies native enforcement through that test
outlet, not production direct egress or DNS. An earlier Codex probe incorrectly
required a complete result file after native denial; the corrected probe requires
the corresponding native rejection when the tool is interrupted. One initial
MiniMax run failed before its first tool call; an independent rerun passed, without
a Core change or an established root cause for that failure.

Focused policy/API/adapter/PostgreSQL tests, the real Codex managed-process lifecycle
test and the complete Core `make check` passed. Optional Docker fault fixtures were
not enabled; real public Docker runs cover the accepted paths. The first full-check
invocation lacked the server's OpenSSL development paths; the corrected invocation
passed with a fresh database. Evidence and failed attempts remain under
`~/.parsar/remediation/20260921/template-network-native/` and the Feishu task record.
Core SHA-256: `0dc40384192fc75c4be9896072dfe0089c30a02e44804faca7a14c7d8525efa3`.
E2B probes remain mechanism evidence only; this batch does not qualify official
E2B self-hosted onboarding or complete upstream network semantics.

### Resource and initialization checks

`official_environment_templates.py` checks all five fixed-SDK operations plus raw
HTTP, exact safe response shapes, field replacement/defaults, pagination, tenant
isolation and rejected confidential canaries. `official_e2b_v1.py` opts in with
private `verify_environment_templates: true`; it creates its actual native/model
Sessions from public templates, verifies frozen snapshots and creation retries
after update/delete, then reuses the existing execution, Files/Artifacts, isolation,
cancellation and crash/history-recovery assertions. Its disabled-network Session
inherits that policy from another template. Runtime and provider packaging were
unchanged in the original metadata-only batch. Database integration tests cover persistence and concurrent field updates;
API tests cover parsing and caller-intent distinctions.

`official_environment_initial_files.py` and the `verify_initial_files: true` option
together with `verify_environment_templates: true` in the real E2B runner add
both-source/template/inline metadata, source-deletion,
foreign-tenant and actual first-native-read checks. Existing Files/Artifacts,
cancel/crash/history checks then verify that initialization did not change the
execution loop or overwrite later user modifications. Controlled PostgreSQL lifecycle
tests separately exercise interrupted installation, readiness and maintenance fairness.
A test's presence is not a passing acceptance result; retain actual run evidence.

### Accepted initial-file profiles (2026-09-20)

The batch passed fixed SDK 3.13.0/raw HTTP acceptance with real models on Docker
and E2B for Codex, Claude Code and MiniMax Code. Both template and inline paths
verified initial native reads, Files/Artifacts, tenant and credential isolation,
source/template deletion followed by creation retry, cancellation, and preserved
workspace changes/native history after Core and Runtime restarts. E2B also verified
Core interruption during initialization: no native execution, no replay and owned
resource reclamation. All six completed runs reported clean resource cleanup.

Separate real Provider checks covered Docker binary stdin/backpressure and E2B
50 MiB stdin. The real shared installer verified empty, binary, nested and 50 MiB
files, rejected symlink destinations, and preserved outside bytes. PostgreSQL/race
suites and `make check` passed. The optional native build probe skipped by the
default gate is not counted as real acceptance. Runtime images were the retained
qualified builds; Core was built from this batch. E2B runs preceded the final
readiness guard and store-interface cleanup, which received targeted regression;
The six-profile matrix preceded final creation-intent size and canonical-identity
corrections. Real HTTP/PostgreSQL regression accepted a 1 MiB file and two 5 MiB
inline files with retries, and verified canonical template/file encryption bindings.
A further rebuilt standalone Docker/Codex run passed a 5 MiB initial file with
real model reads, Artifacts, cancellation and retained history in 101.23 seconds.
The original Docker matrix used Core SHA-256
`31973b17dd96106743e581c400555e3a4b036ad8cb3e68b51530a2b56023abe3`.

Docker MiniMax Code passed with the real MiniMax API at its standard HTTPS origin
through the test network relay. Earlier Kimi/MiniMax connection timeouts remain
recorded with unknown cause, as does a Docker reconnect failure under a different
Core/Runtime restart order. They are not claimed as fixed. Sanitized run results,
checks, build hashes and failed attempts are retained under the private
`environment-template-files` acceptance directory and the linked task record.

### Accepted env/setup and npm/Python batch

`official_environment_setup.py` adds fixed-client/raw-response assertions for
confidential snapshots, safe package metadata, real registry dependencies, ordered
setup, native visibility across cwd and the post-setup network boundary. Runtime
mechanism tests cover private files/processes, immutable configuration, child
cleanup and failure receipts. The batch passed real-model template and inline acceptance on newly built Docker
Runtimes for Codex, Claude Code and MiniMax Code, plus Codex on a newly built E2B
template. Each verified actual npm/PyPI installs, ordered setup, native env and
dependency visibility across working directories, Files/Artifacts, cancellation,
post-setup disabled networking and recovery without repeating initialization. E2B
also verified daemon/history/process/envd isolation and separate Core/Runtime
crashes with exact native history and no automatic input replay.

The shared initializer additionally passed actual Docker isolation probes for all
three profiles and E2B registry installation. Docker nonzero setup and missing cwd
failed before native Turns and reclaimed the Environment. PostgreSQL/race checks
cover encrypted owner/field-bound snapshots, readiness and uncertain-install cleanup.
A rebuilt standalone Core passed real fixed-SDK/raw-HTTP retries with changed, added
and removed inline env/setup under a saved Agent; unchanged retries still recover
after Agent deletion. Only this creation-identity regression required the final
Core rebuild; the completed model matrix preceded that isolated hash correction.

One MiniMax inline post-restart model request reported an upstream timeout after
100 seconds. The affected inline rerun passed in 214.75 seconds, with no production
transport changes; this does not establish or fix the timeout cause. All completed
runs confirmed owned resource cleanup. The three-harness-by-two-Provider matrix
was not repeated: shared E2B initialization and the changed native adapter paths
were covered separately. System packages were outside that batch; their current
qualification is recorded separately. Unconfirmed reference overrides remain gaps,
and native Codex hook failure retains the limitation stated above.
Private sanitized run/check/build evidence is retained under
`~/.parsar/remediation/20260920/environment-template-setup/` and the linked board.
These results do not establish complete Template or Agents API compatibility.


### Accepted inline-Skill profiles (2026-09-20)

`official_environment_skills.py` supplies fixed-client/raw-HTTP checks and a
native-discovered Skill whose helper produces an unpredictable Artifact, checks
private credentials/staging, and attempts to modify its own installed manifest.
Standalone Core, dedicated PostgreSQL and freshly packaged Docker Runtimes passed
with Codex 0.153.4/Kimi, Claude SDK 0.3.269 (native 2.1.269)/Kimi, and MiniMax Code
0.4.12/MiniMax-M3. Codex covered template and inline configuration; Claude and
MiniMax covered the template path through the same initializer. All verified safe
metadata, foreign-tenant rejection, frozen snapshots after template clear/delete,
creation retry, native Skill execution, Files/Artifacts, cancellation, and owned
history/workspace recovery after Core and Runtime restart. Cleanup completed.
The Core binary SHA-256 was
`85be1bc26ca6c03617ba74bf092485656dda9311bb636d507be6576a2f087f16`.

The shared initializer also passed on a real Docker container and E2B VM, including
binary/executable content, read-only Skill access from setup, duplicate/path
rejection and private-state isolation. This batch did not repeat the E2B model
matrix: Provider code is unchanged, while its shared initialization boundary was
exercised in a real VM. PostgreSQL/API/archive tests, Claude SDK tests/build,
`make openapi`, `make sqlc-generate` and `make check` passed. The default gate's
optional native build probe remains skipped and is not counted as live acceptance.

Initial integration failed safely because the proposed Skill parent was root-owned;
using the existing Runtime initialization directory resolved that packaging
boundary without broadening permissions. The earlier MiniMax/Kimi native timeout
and probe-only unrestricted-tool configuration failure remain recorded. The latter
passed after restoring the unchanged production tool settings. Docker builds reused
qualified base images after registry DNS failure; current daemon, adapter and
initializer artifacts were copied using the repository packaging recipe. Raw
receipts retain their inherited historical manifest fields; accompanying source,
Core and image hashes identify the actual candidates. Evidence is retained under
`~/.parsar/remediation/20260920/environment-template-skills` and the linked board
record. This profile does not establish complete upstream Skill semantics.

### System-package qualification (2026-09-20)

The batch passed standalone Docker acceptance with current-source Core/daemon and
newly packaged Codex, Claude Code and MiniMax Code Runtimes. Fixed SDK 3.13.0 and
raw HTTP exercised public templates; Codex also exercised inline configuration.
Actual Kimi/MiniMax requests verified jq, compiler/libpq linkage, dependent
npm/Python packages, ordered setup, native visibility, read-only installed roots,
Skill/credential protection, Files/Artifacts, public cancellation and retained
workspace/native history after Core and Runtime restart. Cancellation checks
observed tool identities disappear before sandbox teardown. All three completed
runs reported clean resource cleanup. Template omission, replacement, null/empty
values and atomic invalid-input rejection received additional real HTTP checks.

The Core SHA-256 was
`9466a8419fd0e4ad8cd4fb1786ef131c2cc504513bf77642fca43ce07b8114a6`.
The Codex template/inline run took 599.72 seconds; Claude and MiniMax template
runs took 271.69 and 357.34 seconds. Real initialization mechanism checks separately
covered isolated package scripts and compilation. Focused Go/SDK tests, OpenAPI
generation and `make check` passed. The optional native build probe skipped by
the default gate is not counted as real acceptance.

E2B finalization rewrites `/usr/local` permissions. Its trusted bootstrap must
restore the common system-tool launcher's packaged `0555` mode before native
preparation; root ownership alone does not satisfy that Runtime receipt check.
The first qualified Codex E2B template passed real Kimi template and inline acceptance in
576.41 seconds, including final seed/launcher protection, actual package/setup
visibility, Files/Artifacts, credential/history/process/envd isolation, public
cancellation, separate Core/Runtime crashes, continued owned history without
input or initialization replay, preserved user files, and disabled native-tool
networking. Cleanup completed without fallback errors. This run uses the updated
daemon with the bounded discovery adjustment described below. The immutable build
is `1b60xhq0j13fnr5zipkg:7d11189a-b2bd-4690-bc3f-da0792439f91`. The full
three-harness E2B matrix was not repeated: shared initialization and the changed
native adapter paths were covered separately.

Independent review then identified a missing native cwd alias: the installed tool
root exposed `/workspace`, while Codex retained `/environment/workspace`. Both
now mount the same authorized workspace. A rebuilt Docker Runtime passed actual
system/npm/Python initialization and entry from the default directory and its
subdirectory in 106.30 seconds, including private-state isolation and read-only
tools. The earlier model runs selected `/workspace` and do not prove this fix.
The rebuilt E2B template
`1b60xhq0j13fnr5zipkg:e6437586-927e-4683-99fe-632b51a974fd` then passed the
real Kimi template/inline loop in 457.91 seconds. Native command Items and actual
effects verified the default directory and subdirectory; the same run passed
Files/Artifacts, private-state isolation, cancellation, Core/Runtime recovery,
preserved history and user modifications, and disabled tool networking. Cleanup
reported no errors. The final mount-only correction received this actual regression
and Python source checks; the two full `make check` runs precede it.

Failed attempts are retained: early admission incorrectly required the private
initialization receipt; execution preparation now owns that check. Test-only proxy
configuration and simultaneous package installation attempts failed before the
sequential accepted runs, without extending production budgets. E2B cold discovery
once killed `codex --version`; unchanged discovery subsequently passed, but a later cold deployment repeated
the failure with no observed OOM. The shared CLI availability probe now allows
15 seconds instead of five; no retry or Provider-specific startup path is added.
The precise initial paging/contention cause remains unconfirmed. Docker execution
results above precede this isolated startup-budget adjustment. The E2B launcher-mode mismatch failed preparation before any
native input was applied. The subsequent native isolation fixture assumed
`sudo` existed; the real tool transcript showed `FileNotFoundError`. The fixture
now records an absent privilege command explicitly while retaining all authority
and private-state checks. Interactive PTY behavior and packages needing additional
Unix identities or privileged services are not qualified by these results.

Sanitized results, image/source hashes, full checks and failed evidence are retained
under `~/.parsar/remediation/20260920/environment-template-capabilities` and the board.
Early Docker result manifests contain inherited installer archive fields; those
fields do not qualify a new installer archive. Current binary and image hashes
identify the tested deployment. These checks do not establish complete upstream
Template or Agents API compatibility.
